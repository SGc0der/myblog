The Pyramid of Giza is one of the World's Seven Wonders. If I am asked to go there, believe me, I won't. I was burning because of the heat. The people eat a lot of nutritional food in Egypt. It was a good time with my parents. I had seen the dry deserts from the plane. The food was very tasty. In breakfast, we would eat prawn, for vegetarians, fruit and vegetable salad. While coming back to India, we bought some cups and traditional showpieces from the airport.</p>

Artificial snow was falling and there were so many toys of Disney Characters, you couldn't choose what you want to buy and what not to buy. The castle was so beautiful, I didn't want to leave. It was a very crowded place. We saw dummies of Donald Duck, Mickey Mouse, Toy Story and much more. Next, I want to visit the disney land in California.</p>

The floor was tough glass and you could see stingrays, octopuses, clownfishes, sharks and so much more. The cutest animal I found was the dolphin. The breeze was so cold, we had to wear something thick. I want to go there again and enjoy. We clicked many photos.

                <p>A movie you should definitely watch. This movie is the sequel of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001). I loved the idea of a secret chamber Salazar Slytherin built. Harry Potter hears voices in the corridors of Hogwarts and discovers he can talk to snakes, a very rare gift. It is when he discovers the heir of Salazar, T.M. Riddle. Riddle called his gigantic snake, also known as Basilisk. Then, a phoenix comes and the sword of Gryffindor appears. He fights with the Basilisk, destroys Riddle's one Horcrux and uncovers many secrets of Hogwarts.</p>

                <p>This movie is about a boy and a dark wizard naming Credence and Grindelwald. Grindelwald transforms himself to Mr. Graves to get closer to Credence. At first, he thought Credence's sister is an Obscurial (a witch or wizard who develops a dark magical parasitic force). But, the Obscurus lived for a longer time, thus making Credence an Obscurial. Grindelwald wanted to kill Dumbledore with the Obscurus. Newt gives a tour to a Muggle, Kowalski and shows his whole world of magical creatures. At the City Square, Grindelwald reveals himself as Credence gets killed.</p>

The fires that raged across the Brazilian Amazon this summer were not 'normal' and large increases in deforestation could explain why, scientists show. Although fires in the Amazon can occur in a number of ways, the scientists show that there is strong evidence to link this year's increases to deforestation. The researchers acknowledge that the number of active fires decreased in September by 35 per cent.</p>

                            <p class="p_modal">This is an amazing book of Harry Potter. It's is when Voldemort tortures Bertha Jorkins to know about what will happen in Hogwarts. It is when she tells him about the Triwizard Tournament after a lot of pain and torture. The Triwizard Tournament was an event held in Harry's 4th year in Hogwarts. It was a tournament between three wizarding schools, Beauxbatons, Durmstrang and Hogwarts. People only above 17 could participate as it had 3 challenges that could cost your life. All the three schools students above 17 particippate by putting a piece of parchment with their name and school. From Hogwarts, Cedric Diggory was chosen. From Beauxbatons, Fleur Delacour was chosen. From Durmstrang, the famous Quidditch player Viktor Krum was chosen. But wait...another piece of parchment exploded out of the goblet. Guess who? Harry Potter! Everybody was silenced. How could a boy of 14 enter with Dumbledore drawing the age line? He almost got killed by a dragon, almost got drowned in a lake, almost could get dead in the third task. Cedric and Harry reach to the winning cup. It turned out to teleport them the the Little Hangleton. Cedric gets killed, Voldemort rises again, both of them duel. His father starts to appear and tells the Portkey will teleport him back. At the right moment, he grabbed Cedric, shouted "Accio" and went back. One of the teacher turns out to be a Death Eater and put the name inside the goblet so that Harry could die.

                            <p class="p_modal">This is the first Harry Potter book. It's when Harry sees green light in his cupboard. He went to the zoo with his cousin, and with just a stare, puts his cousin Dudley into the cage and releases the snake inside it. He had just talked to a snake. Dudley gets trapped in the glass cage. It was a funny moment. But, he was locked in his cupboard, just with nothing. One morning. Harry goes to recieve mail and gets a letter from Hogwarts. He shows it to Uncle Vernon and he tears it in fury. He said him strictly he is not going anywhere. Now, after a few days, Sunday arrived, which meaned no mail. But instead, mail started flowing out of the box and fills in the house, Harry managed to get hold of one. Uncle Vernon decided to leave this house and live between the oceans. That's when a massive hairy man arrives to check why isn't Harry responding to the mail. He tells him many secrets. He told him about his parents, who were wizards. Aunt Petunia had told Harry his parents died in a car crash, but the reality was a very dark wizard, as bad as you can go, killed Lily and James Potter. Peter and Severus, two followers of Voldemort led them to death. He visits Hogwarts and his scar burned. Hagrid had told him that his scar was there because when Voldemort tried to kill Harry, the curse rebounded, making a mark that an evil curse could make. He discovers that Quirell tries to steal the Philosopher's Stone that could make a person immortal. At first they blamed Snape. But, whe they go through the trapdoor, Harry meets Quirell. They fight with each other. Guess what? Voldemort was seperated from his body and lived as a soul. He possesed Quirell. Quirell wanted the stone for Voldemort. Harry's protection saved him as Voldemort flees like a soul.

Albus is sorted in Slytherin, the thing he most feared about. His friend, Scorpius was also sorted in Slytherin, just like his father. They met Delphi in their holidays. She told them that she was the cousin of Cedric Diggory, who was dead. Albus and Scorpius decided to time travel and bring Cedric back.

But, when they make fun of Cedric in the second task and come back from the lake, Scorpius discovers that Voldemort Day is being celebrated and Harry was dead. That's why Albus was never born. The headmaster was Dolores Umbridge. Snape was alive. Cedric had became a Death Eater. Scorpius was known as Scorpion King.

                <p class="text-muted">Golgappas, also known as water panckaes can be eaten in different ways. Firstly, it could be eaten plainly. It could also be eaten with curd, tamarind sauce and some corriander chutney. The best way I think about it to be eaten is with the spicy green water and tamarind sauce with stuffing. This Indian food comes in one of the top 10 foods of India. The street golgappas are even tastier than the shop ones.</p>
